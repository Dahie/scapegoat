* by Peter Amende, http://peteramende.de/

== ABOUT SCAPEGOAT ==

* the theme is made for the Piratenpartei Berlin, http://berlin.piratenpartei.de/
* the default slider images and the 404 image are taken by Ben de Biel, http://www.bendebiel.com/
* other browser than webkit or gecko not supported yet, because I don't like them
* upgrade the theme with "skull-" or "ship-graphics" and I will kill you

== HOW TO ==

* first of all, you have to insert some informations about yourself in your profile-section
* use custom menues and insert the start-page to the main-menu, if you want to display the home icon in your header menu
* use widgets for the sidebar and footer. The footer looks best with 4 Widgets with approximately equal heights. Don't use menu widgets in the footer, there is a separate footer-menu
* take a look at the theme-options and improve your front-page with it
* if you disable the slider the description apeares in the sidebar
* give your categories a description! You can use html-tags there as well

== ISSUES ==

* retina icons
* rtl support

== LOG ==

* 01.10.12 - Release
